# Introduction

The expected value of perfect information (EVPI) can be used to identify the most critical knowledge gaps [@Coyle2008; @hubbard2014] and reveal variables for which more information can support decisions [@lanzanova2019]. 

$EVPI$ is calculated as the expected value $EV$ of the decision $D$ with perfect information $PI$, minus the expected value of the decision with current imperfect information $II$:

$$
EVPI = EV D|PI - EV D|II
$$

# Calculating EVPI

## Discreet data

Calculating $EVPI$ with discreet data can be done using estimation of probabilities and possible gains or losses. We use the example of investment in the stock market vs. deposits (bonds):

The expected outcome of the decision to invest in deposits $Expdeposit$ is calculated as the value (y-axis) times the probability of loss or gain under each condition (x-axis):
$$
Expdeposit : 0.2 \cdot 500 + 0.3 \cdot 500 
		+ 0.5 \cdot 500 		= 500 
$$
The expected outcomes of the decision to invest in stocks $Expstock$ is the value of the decision times the probability of loss or gain under each condition:
$$ Expstock:   0.2 \cdot -800 + 0.3 \cdot 600
		+ 0.5 \cdot 1500		= 680 $$
Because  $Expstock$ is the more likely decision to result in a gain it is also known as the Expected Maximum Value $EMV$.

The expected value of the decision given perfect information $EV|PI$ is calculated as the sum of all the best options (always making the more gainful choice) multipled by the respective probabilities:
$$
EV|PI :     0.2 \cdot 500 + 0.3 \cdot 600 
		+ 0.5 \cdot 1500  		= 1030
$$
The Expected Value of Perfect Information $EVPI$ is caculated as the difference between the decision given perfect information $EV|PI$ and the the Expected Maximum Value $EMV$.
$$
EVPI :      1030 – 680 		= 350
$$

Knowing the direction the market will go (having perfect information) before making our decision would help us take hte best deision here. We shoul dbe willing to pay up to 350€ for perfect information on the outcomes.

## Continuous data

In the following example of an agricultural decision to apply fertilizer. We assume that the nutrient content of the soil will follow a normal distribution and that the additional gain in yield under the decision not to apply fertilizer will remain constant (<span style="color:green">green line</span>). 

We simulate a response of the application of fertilizer (<span style="color:red">red line</span>) to show that at a certain point the positive results of the application ends and the fertilizer starts to cause losses in yield.

A and B are the 'areas under the curve' calculated by taking the integral of the curve (up to and from the point of intersection with the zero line, respectively).

<img src="images/Agriculture_example.jpg" alt="agriculture example" align="center" width = "75%" height="75%"/>

In this case the expected value of the decision to apply no fertilizer is zero. The expected value of applying fertilizer is equal to $A - B$, which has a small positive value ($A$ is greater than $B$. This is the decision with the expected maximum value $EMV$ under uncertainty. 

The Expected Value given Perfect Information $EV|PI$ is equal to $A$ and $EVPI$ is caculated as the difference between this and $EMV$ ($A-B$).

$$
EVPI :      A – (A - B) = B
$$

# R Tools

The 'empirical_EVPI()' function in R's 'decisionSupport' library [@decisionSupport2017] calculates EVPI for a simple model with the predictor variable sampled from a normal distribution. The 'multi_EVPI()' function does the same with multiple variables.
