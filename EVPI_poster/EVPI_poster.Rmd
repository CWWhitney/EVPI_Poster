**Abstract** 

The Expected Value of Perfect Information *EVPI* measures the expected loss of gain (expected opportunity loss, EOL) incurred due to lack of information about a paricular variable. It is determined by examining the influence of that variable on the output value of a decision model. EVPI is best illustrated by a plot of weighed decision outcomes as a function of the variable in question. If this curve intersects zero and the recommendation without perfect information is to go ahead with the project, the EVPI is the negative area under the curve, or the positive area if the recommendation is not to go ahead. If there is no intersection point, the EVPI is zero.
